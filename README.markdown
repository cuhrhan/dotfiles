# Dotfiles

This repository contains various dotfiles I usually share across various
systems. The idea is based on the [dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)
repository of [@holman](https://github.com/holman).

Furthermore this repository is based on [dotfiles](https://github.com/bmeurer/dotfiles)
repository of [@bmeurer](https://github.com/bmeurer).

## Installation

- `git clone git://github.com/cuhrhan/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
- `cd ~/.dotfiles`
- `./install.sh`

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`, though.

## License

See the [LICENSE](https://raw.github.com/cuhrhan/dotfiles/master/LICENSE) file
for details.
